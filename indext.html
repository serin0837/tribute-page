        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1907</strong>
            <br />Frida Kahlo y Calderón was born on 6 July 1907 in Coyoacán, a
            village on the outskirts of Mexico City.
            <br />
            Kahlo enjoyed art from an early age, receiving drawing instruction
            from printmaker Fernando Fernández (who was her father's friend) and
            filling notebooks with sketches
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1922 </strong>
            <br />
            Kahlo was accepted to the elite National Preparatory School,where
            she focused on natural sciences with the aim of becoming a doctor
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1925</strong>
            <br />
            Kahlo had been impaled with an iron handrail that went through her
            pelvis. She later described the injury as “the way a sword pierces a
            bull.”
            <br />
            After a bus accident in 1925 left Kahlo unable to walk for three
            months, Kahlo began to paint in order to pass the time. She started
            to consider a career as a medical illustrator, as well, which would
            combine her interests in science and art.
          </li>
          <li>
            <string>1929 </string>
            <br />
            Kahlo and Rivera were married in a civil ceremony at the town hall
            of Coyoacán and moved to Morelos, Cuernavaca
            <br />
            She changed her artistic style and increasingly drew inspiration
            from Mexican folk art
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1930</strong>
            <br />
            Kahlo and Rivera moved to San Francisco
            <br />
            Kahlo was introduced to American artists, The six months spent in
            San Francisco were a productive period for Kahlo as she further
            developed the folk art style she had adopted in Cuernavaca. Although
            she still publicly presented herself as simply Rivera's spouse
            rather than as an artist, she participated for the first time in an
            exhibition, when Frieda and Diego Rivera was included in the Sixth
            Annual Exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artists in
            the Palace of the Legion of Honor.
            <!--she made Frieda and Diego Rivera (1931), a double portrait based on their wedding photograph,[26] and The Portrait of Luther Burbank (1931),-->

          <li>
            <strong>1932</strong>
            <br />
            Kahlo and Rivera moved to Detroit, Kahlo experienced numerous health
            problems related to a failed pregnancy
            <br />
            Despite these health problems, as well as her dislike for the
            capitalist culture of the United States, Kahlo's time in the city
            was beneficial for her artistic expression.
            <!-- her painting Amongst the works she made in the retablo manner in Detroit are Henry Ford Hospital (1932), My Birth (1932), and Self-Portrait on the Border of Mexico and the United States (1932).[33] -->

             <strong>1937 -1939</strong>
             <br>
             Kahlo's artistic career was extremely productive, following her divorce and then reconciliation with Rivera.
             She made her first significant sale in the summer of 1938 when film star and art collector Edward G. Robinson purchased four paintings at $200 each.
             international recognition (New York,Paris)
             <!-- creating such works as My Nurse and I (1937), Memory, the Heart (1937), Four Inhabitants of Mexico (1938), and What the Water Gave Me (1938)-->
          </li>
            <strong>1940s </strong>
            <br>
            her health continued to decline. By the mid-1940s, her back
            had worsened to the point that she could no longer sit or stand
            <br>
            In 1941, her works were featured at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston
            Kahlo gained more appreciation for her art in Mexico as well.
          
          <!-- Her paintings from this period, such as Broken Column (1944), Without
          Hope (1945), Tree of Hope, Stand Fast (1946), and The Wounded Deer
          (1946), reflect her declining health.[69] -->
        </li>
          <li>
            1950 -1953 - Kahlo spent most of the year in Hospital ABC in Mexico City,
            where she underwent a new bone graft surgery on her spine

            and thus staged her first solo exhibition in Mexico at the Galería Arte Contemporaneo in April 1953.[75] Though Kahlo was initially not due to attend the opening, as her doctors had prescribed bed rest for her, she ordered her four-poster bed to be moved from her home to the gallery. To the surprise of the guests, she arrived in an ambulance and was carried on a stretcher to the bed, where she stayed for the duration of the party.[75] The exhibition was a notable cultural event in Mexico and also received attention in mainstream press around the world.[76] The same year, the Tate Gallery's exhibition on Mexican art in London featured five of her paintings.[77]
          </li>
          <li>1954 - Kahlo was 47 years old.</li>
          <!--Her last paintings include the political Marxism Will Give Health to the Sick (c. 1954) and Frida and Stalin (c. 1954) and the still-life Viva La Vida (1954).[80]-->
        </ul>
        <!--I want to put her painting with times-->
        <p>
          The Tate Modern considers Kahlo "one of the most significant artists
          of the twentieth century",[248] while according to art historian
          Elizabeth Bakewell, she is "one of Mexico's most important
          twentieth-century figures"
